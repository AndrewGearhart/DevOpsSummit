This repo holds planning documents and breakout notes for the DevOps 4 Libraries Summit.

## DevOps Summit

We hold an annual 2-day unconference-style meeting at Princeton University. The date / time-of-year
varies. Group size has been 15-30 people.

Process: We gather together to brainstorm topics we want to discuss. Then we vote on each
one, with each participant voting as many times as they want. The group works
together, with a facilitator, to determine which topics should be plenary and which should be broken
into smaller / parallel tracks.

Everyone should come ready to participate by sharing problems and/or solutions.
