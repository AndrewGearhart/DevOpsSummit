Day 2 Retrospective
---

pluses

- Lots of the conversations were around how to apply devops, and not why should we do devops
- Inviting the whole c4l community
- Budget neutral
- Running multiple across the country
- For people who have not done devops, felt good about learning new things
- The gatekeeper role
- The discussion of failures
- Like that we have tooling, and soft/human stuff
- Really liked the non-conference stuff
- Happy to see pronouns displayed

deltas

+ Sessions could have been shorter today
	+ The hour and a half isn't helpful across the board
	+ Don't know before hand
	+ But, some topics felt good being put together
	+ Not being afraid to combine topics
	+ Second day groups were smaller
+ Vet technical knowledge sharing for helpfulness
+ Role assignment is important
+ Receipt confirming signup
+ Sending out driving directions
+ squeak chairs
+ 2 day conference in 2 places can be a little stressfull
+ Maybe we can figure out a way to schedule topics before hand
