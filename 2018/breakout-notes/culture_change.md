## Discussion

Coordinator syndrome, warned against taking new jobs in a niche, they aren't well understood and people don't have the power to make any changes happen.

This is kind of similar to the fact that development organization have tech debt but aren't able to get the time to pay down tech debt.

We should make sure to have people who are in charge of specific initiatives

We need clear goals in order to optimize our process.

It's hard to define goals in a measurable way. But, we can defined success in terms of access to knowledge, or something not as measurable.

If we aren't measuring our goals, can we feel that we are meeting our goals. Possibly, because when it feels bad we are probably on to something.

Difficult conversations, a book, describes how feelings interact

When we think about territorials, work used to be done in certain way, because in libraries we did things in a DIY way. In that way just doesn't make sense to DIY anymore, we need to level up.

How do we enforce that.

Hard to enforce, but maybe you can build coalition, and then you have to get the organization on board.

Penn checks in weekly with the team, that coordinates everyone. They feel this works well to keep everyone in the same page.

How is devops a series of cultural changes

Can you work on trust. Setting the tone as a team.
