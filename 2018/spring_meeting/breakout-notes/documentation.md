#Documentation
##What kind of Docs?  Internal VS External?
Trying to document an old thing that has been in production a long time can be hard because it has a lot of specifics to the implementation, 
Even shortly after developing something, realizing that it still doesn’t do enough.
QA testing documentation can be useful - Observing someone using it can be useful as well.

Where to start documentation? 
With infrequent and complicated - good place to start for documentation, and that documentation is a good place to start with automation.

We need to find ways to find time to create the documentation.

Maybe ask users of the software to write docs, as they will provide a lot of insight 

Documentation driven development


Succession planning - will people know where to pick stuff up and what parts the project is made of.

Princeton the hard way, based on Kubernetes the Hard Way. All the gotchas you will expect that have not yet been documented 

Part of the Bug Resolution process could be updating the docs about when the bug could be encountered.

Be careful about where documentation is happening. Google Docs and Slack messages can disappear when someone leaves an organization.

One suggestion - pull all documentation from multiple orgs into a Solr/Blacklight ? Make it all searchable?

	Example story - All meetings go into a wiki, all systems documented in a central place. It can be done in a single place.

There will always be certain things that are more important than others.

Maybe do documentation in meetings themselves. Working meetings.

Documentation is a form of maintenance. 

So many things that are hidden from sight, like command line tools, autocomplete, etc.

New Users can be a great opportunity to test your docs. They will give you great insights into how well documentation is working.

Conversations happening on slack are documented in a way that in person can’t be. It forces slowed down, deliberate conversations, even if it slows down the process.

We also have to be honest that technical writing is hard. So we can’t be too hard about how “great” the docs are. Bad docs are better than no docs.

Building documentation sprints into the yearly cycle is important.


##Training / Keeping Up To Date

Really hard to keep up to date on things if projects are newish and moving fast.
Scheduled weekly tech sharing meetings where an individual takes initiative to talk, informally, about a technology. 
Some do the same idea, of tech sharing, but more concentrated, once / twice a year.
