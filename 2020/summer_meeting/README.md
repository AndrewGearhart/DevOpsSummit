## DevOps4lib 2020 Summer Summit hosted by Princeton

### General Information

The DevOps4Lib 2020 Summer Summit will be held Wednesday, May 6th and Thursday, May 7th on zoom. Attendees will receive an email with connection info.

Hours:

* May 6 (Wednesday): 11am - 5pm Eastern
* May 7 (Thursday): 11am - 2pm Eastern

### Conference Chat
This year chat will be discouraged in favor of centralized communication in
google docs. This will help all hosts and attendees stay focused on our
discussion. The docs will each have an area for "miscellaneous" links, comments,
and out-of-band notes.

Many 5-minute breaks are scheduled throughout the day. These are intended for quick bio needs and stretching / looking out the window to care for our bodies.
