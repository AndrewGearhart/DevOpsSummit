## DevOps4lib 2019 Summer Summit in Princeton

### General Information
The  DevOps4Lib 2019 Summer Summit will be held Wednesday, July 10th and Thursday, July 11th at [McCosh Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McCosh+Hall,+Princeton,+NJ+08544/@40.348295,-74.6587818,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c3e6c3eec86f0b:0xddfa22d7d9056f32!8m2!3d40.348295!4d-74.6565931).

We're in room 26. If you enter McCosh at Entry 2 (north / long side of the
building), go to the 2nd floor and it's around to the right.

### Getting here
Parking is available on campus in [Guest Lot
23](https://www.google.com/maps/place/West+Visitor+Parking+Lot+23/@40.3436018,-74.6648427,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!3m1!2sWest+Visitor+Parking+Lot+23!3m4!1s0x0:0x3b967abaef3ec8b6!8m2!3d40.3405338!4d-74.6566916)
at no charge.

The [Central Line Shuttle](https://transportation.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/A-Central.pdf) (pdf) goes around campus. The venue is between the Nassau stop (15) and the Frist stop (19) so either would be a fine place to get off.

### Food
Coffee and lunch will be provided.

### Conference Chat
