###What does DevOps mean? 
* Is there some list of "things that are devops things"?
  * What we call operations now that we develop more 
  * An evolution from more “traditional IT” to an environment where there is more communication between system admins and those who need access to hardware/tech
  * Thinking more of the operations perspective as a developer and thinking more of the developer perspective from the operations side
    * How are we going to deploy this?
    * Communication vs specific tool?
    * Less a list of specific tasks
  * Bridging skill sets
  * Setting team members up to succeed, set up tasks or tools that are easy to understand and can be used regardless of how deep the knowledge is on a particular process -> prevents the reliance on a single person being available 24hrs a day

###Interdisciplinary field
* Being in the middle of a process, facilitating development and getting products to users, making sure that tools and products are stable
* Synthesizing environments and disciplines
* Traditional it provides a machine. DevOps involves deeper learning about the application in order to support its life cycle more fully.
* Documenting the process so that you can share the load.
* Smaller components in Infrastructure.

###Processing and manufacturing standpoint, identifying and removing bottlenecks. Roles and tasks change depending on what the bottlenecks are.
“Deving the Ops”
Bottlenecks change

Agile setup, containers, microservices, big monolithic systems can be run in via devops techniques

Removing single points of failure and people who are the only one who can do something.
And the single point of failure changes over time

### Making 
* “Opsing the Devs"
* Someone in the role may need to do a lot of training
* "Emotional Support Engineer"
* Understanding the tools, roles, and skills of the other side
* Traditionally both sides didn’t want to collaborate, rather ask for something and then move on

Automatic deployments, after pushing code to a certain place
Creating similar development and production environments

### An engineering discipline for applied information technology
* Old style was just doing stuff
* New style engineering process and feedback
* We had to change because the stakes are much higher now for most organizations.
* MInimal dev-ops, making old style IT look like devops!

### Terms central to DevOps
* Playbooks
* containers
* Continuous Integration/Development
* Orchestration
* Site reliability (value to end user)
