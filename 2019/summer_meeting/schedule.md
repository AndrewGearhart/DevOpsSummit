## Breakout tips
* Select a facilitator, a notetaker, a timekeeper, and a gatekeeper
  * a gatekeeper is an advocate for full participation in the session. Some duties of the gatekeeper are:
    * slowing the conversation at times to ensure everyone can participate
    * asking for clarification on acronyms, tooling names or other phrases so everyone understands the conversation
    * bringing any inappropriate/discriminatory behavior to duty officers for resolution
* Start with a problem statement or try to answer the following questions:
  * What do we do well?
  * What would you like to improve?
  * What are the desired deliverables?
  * What are our use cases?

## Day 1 retro
Continue
  * Timekeeping, gatekeeping, all roles. Well-organized day.
  * Converting notes to markdown and pushing to github (could be more
    distributed).
  * Time-limiting sub-topics.
  * Allowing exploration slightly outside of our pre-planned agenda.
  * Leaving some section of topics to be open-ended.
  * Facilitating awesome
  * Taking short breaks between conversations - 10 minutes has felt about right.
  * Continue single track with a group this size
  * Coordination of food and space awesome
  * Offering left over food to campus population
  * Notes have been great

Start
  * Take one longer break in addition to lunch, probably in the afternoon.
  * Lunch could be a bit later.
  * Could fit more sessions in the morningo n day 2.
  * Scope out the room the night before and send details over email
  * Ensuring in advance the room is well-equipped for power, A/C
  * Ensuring in advance the room is large enough for registered attendees.
  * Asking gatekeeper to remind people about volume.
  * Do more gatekeeping to ensure all voices are being surfaced.
    * Stop with 1-5 min at the end of each topic/subtopic to check in.
  * Non-assigned notetakers: please annotate / add to notes as we go along.

Stop
  * Being so hot
